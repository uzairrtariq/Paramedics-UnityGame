# Paramedics

First project in game development using Unity. Driving game inspired by old and classic online game called Crazy Taxi on Facebook.

To run it, you will need to download it and open it in Unity. There, you will get access to the GUI and C# scripts.

Acknowledgements: This game is developed along with my groupmate Shane Atchley.
